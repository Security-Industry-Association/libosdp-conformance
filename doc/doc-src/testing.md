Testing osdp_CRAUTH
===================

send a genauth command.  no keepactive, no acurxsize, no cap/pdcap so acu thinks the pd supports minimum
size packets and that is all.

{ "command":"genauth","template":"challenge","keyref":8E","algoref":"07","payload":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}

confirm calc of SDU is correct

confirm monitor got it and dumped it properly

with verbosity 9 confirm PD accepted it.

confirm PD saved the fragment

send an ack back (check this)

when the ack comes back know there's a multi-part message in process and
continue the CRAUTH.

repeat until done.

for now don't ask the PD to process it.

also in secure channel
