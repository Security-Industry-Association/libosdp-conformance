Assumptions
	systemd
	raspbian

1. load the libosdp-conformance and osdp-service packages onto
a stock rasbian 32bit machine.

2. give the machine a static IP address as you'll be accessing it via http.

3. install apache2

  apt-get install -y apache2

4. install the two packages with dpkg

  dpkg -i libosdp-conformance_... osdp-service_...

5. It created a user opsadmin1 and added it to the sudo and dialout groups.
Set the password for opsadmin1.

  sudo passwd opsadmin1

6. add "enable-secure-channel":"DEFAULT" to
/opt/osdp-conformance/run/ACU/open-osdp-params.json

7. start osdp with "systemctl start osdp"


Note that at this point you can pass in commands by creating 
a 1-line text file and pushing it to the control socket:

  echo "{\"blah\":\"1\"}" >/tmp/thing1.json
  /opt/osdp-coformance/bin/open-osdp-kick ACU </tmp/thing1.json
