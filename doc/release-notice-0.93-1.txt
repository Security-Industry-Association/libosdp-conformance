updated documentation to include scbk-default, port parameter.

corrected issue where comset and id would not be transmitted
if the PD is in "NAK everything, I want encryption" mode.

tuned serial write logic to improve behavior during file transfer.

added port parameter to settings.  this is the port number at the other end of a tcp connection
for osdp-tcp-client (and other uses.)

New parameters in open-osdp-params.json read at start-up.
These configure the report in the PDCAP response.

New setting: "capability-sounder", possible values are "0" or "1".
New setting: "capability-text", possible values are "0" or "1".  This
is for a one line 16 character display.

known issues:

(700 ms timeout)
