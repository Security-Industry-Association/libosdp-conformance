Changes in 0.91-14

fix pd tracing to only dump input buffer once

updated documentation to include scbk-default, port parameter.

corrected issue where comset and id would not be transmitted
if the PD is in "NAK everything, I want encryption" mode.

tuned serial write logic to improve behavior during file transfer.

added port parameter to settings.  this is the port number at the other end of a tcp connection
for osdp-tcp-client (and other uses.)
